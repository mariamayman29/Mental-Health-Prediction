# Mental Health Prediction 🧠

A machine learning project focused on predicting mental health conditions using data-driven approaches to support early intervention and awareness.

## Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and predict mental health conditions based on various behavioral, demographic, and contextual factors. By leveraging data science, we aim to contribute to the growing field of mental health informatics and support better understanding of mental health patterns.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning and feature engineering pipelines
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: In-depth visualization and statistical analysis of mental health datasets
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various classification algorithms to predict mental health conditions
- **Model Evaluation**: Detailed performance metrics and comparison across different models
- **Interpretability**: Feature importance analysis to understand key factors affecting predictions

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mariamayman29/Mental-Health-Prediction.git
cd Mental-Health-Prediction
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
